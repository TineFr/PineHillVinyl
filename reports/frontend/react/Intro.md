## Why I chose React


In school, I came across Vue. In my internship, I came across Angular. As to expand my knowledge, React was the logical choice here. It allows me to have a little bit of knowledge in the three main javascript frameworks/libraries for building user interfaces. It is almost unavoidable that I will encounter one of these three when I go into frontend developer direction later on.
