## Introduction

For styling, I've been debating between two options: SASS and styled components. In order to to make the right choice, I've done extensive research on the two, looking at both the pros and cons. From this research I could conclude that both are  good, and no wrong choice could be made. Tho I did come across devided opinions, stating that javacript and CSS should be seperated. Which is in line with what was taught in course.

Despite this controversy, I ultimately decided to work with styled components. This is because this library can only be used with React, so I thought it would be a unique opportunity to give this approach a try. Styled components is relatively new, and has seen a growing interest by big companies such as BBC, Vimeo, Disney, Riot Games, Spotify, and many more.
